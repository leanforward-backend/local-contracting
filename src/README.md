Going to be building my contracting portfolio.

Goals for this project:
Time limit - 3 days
Embeded videos and animations
Contact section - user can send me a contract request via / text message
Requester will recive a confirmation email stating that I will get back to them
Backend storage of who has sent the email and thair contact details
Website scannable on QR
Works on mobile
Potentially a reactive codded background, such as game of life to add intrest and engagement





Ideas:
could have a request to cluade to generate some sort of code image each time the page loads for the background. you are able to then click to see what it has created with a button at the bottom of the page
